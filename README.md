# Database-Systems-Final-Project

This project is completed by Andrew Tavcar, Wei Zhao and Vedang Mondreti.

Start by installing the Database and Web Server Software needed. 
See DB-Installation.pdf

After installation and establishing a connection on port 3336, open Localhost:8888 on your web browser and start a new database. 
Once started, you can import the tabledefinitions file and see that your database has been created. 

Lastly, import some initial data into the database using tableinserts so that we can start off with an already filled database with other recipes already posted.

Our project was completed using Python/Flask to create our web applications and HTML for the Front end. 
Install the following packages...

In the terminal, run
pip install python
pip install Flask
pip install pymysql

After the packages are all installed, begin a connection with your server running on port 3336 and run init.py.  

This will begin the connection between the database and the application.  

In a web browser, navigate to localhost:3336 and begin navigating through the CookZilla application.
